<h1>Develop an Algorithm in Python</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
An algorithm is a set of steps that can be used to solve a problem. Security analysts develop algorithms to provide the solutions that they need for their work. For example, an analyst may work with users who bring them devices. The analyst may need an algorithm that first checks if a user is approved to access the system and then checks if the device that they have brought is the one assigned to them. <br/>
<br />
In this lab, you'll develop an algorithm in Python that automates this process.
<br />

<h2>Scenario</h2>
In this lab, you're working as a security analyst and you're responsible for developing an algorithm that connects users to their assigned devices. You'll write code that indicates if a user is approved on the system and has brought their assigned device to the security team.
